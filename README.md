### BookTunes

An enhanced version of audiobooks for bibliophiles. We aim to design an app that caters to the readerâ€™s needs, and helps in the enhancement of user retention and focus by incorporating multi-voice audiobooks, a discussion room that would enable users to explore new genres and include a goal target to enhance user productivity and learnability.

This is a University project for the course DES102 - Introduction To Human Centered Design
